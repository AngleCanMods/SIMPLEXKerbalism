		// Parts Localization

		// ********** Part: kerbalism-activeshield
		#kerbalism-activeshield_Part_description = Generate a magnetic field around the vessel, reducing incoming radiation.

		#kerbalism-antenna_Part_title = Communotron 8

		// ********** Part: kerbalism-chemicalplant

		// ********** Part: kerbalism-container-inline-125
		#kerbalism-container-inline-125_Part_description = One of the guys at JPL had a simple and brilliant idea: bigger containers to store more supplies. After a couple thousands man-months and 300M in fundings, the prototype was ready for early testing.
